# KitPvP-Network
A server setup referring to ModernMC Kit PvP.

This is the source configs and maps for a commissioned kitpvp server for a network called ModernMC. It was requested to be uploaded as a free to use open source project on github. 
It is primarily here as a portfolio project to demonstrate ability, however it is a working server and can be installed quite easily.

INSTALLATION STEPS:
Create a 1.18.2 paper server and fill out the eula.
Delete non essential files generated/replace any generated files with the files on this github. Keep server offline.
Install necessary jars and maps (Read attached text documents (MMCKITPVPMAPS.txt, MMCKITPVPPLUGINS.txt) for sources and credits)
Boot up the server.

Server should now be working correctly. 

One important thing to note is that while the server was designed for crackshot, it doesn't necessarily require said plugins. Vanilla combat should work as well. Crackshotplus is currently abandonware so if you are interested in firearms, it is recommended to switch to weaponmechanics.

Credits for everyone related can be found in MMCKITPVPMAPS.txt, MMCKITPVPPLUGINS.txt, and the mortiscitations config.yml. Players can see credits in game by running /citations or simply looking at the scoreboard.

If you are one of the original map/plugin makers and have any problems regarding this project's usage of work. Please let us know.

Thank you and have a nice day.
